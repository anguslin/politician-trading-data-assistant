# Politician Trading Data Assistant - Backend

Node.js + Express backend that connects a static frontend (GitHub Pages) to the Hugging Face LLM API and the [MCP Capitol Trades](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anguslin/mcp-capitol-trades) server over the Model Context Protocol (MCP). It detects when MCP data is needed, fetches the data, and asks the LLM to summarize the response for the user.

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

3. Configure your environment variables in `.env`:
   - `HF_API_KEY`: Your Hugging Face API token (required)
   - `API_KEY`: Custom API key for authentication between the frontend and this server (required)
   - `HF_MODEL_TYPE`: Hugging Face model identifier to use (required, e.g. `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3`)
   - `PORT`: Server port (optional, defaults to 3000)
   - `GITHUB_PAGES_DOMAIN`: (optional) Origin allowed by CORS (e.g. `https://your-user.github.io`)
   - `TRUST_PROXY`: (optional) Express proxy trust setting; keep unset locally and set to `1` on Render

### Example `.env` for local development
```dotenv
HF_API_KEY=hf_your_token
API_KEY=local-dev-key
HF_MODEL_TYPE=mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3
PORT=3000
GITHUB_PAGES_DOMAIN=https://your-site.github.io
# TRUST_PROXY intentionally omitted for localhost
```

## Running the Server

Start the server in production mode:
```bash
npm start
```

For development with auto-reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```

Local helpers (automatically set `NODE_ENV=development`):
```bash
npm run start:local
npm run dev:local
```

These scripts expect `.env` to contain `HF_API_KEY`, `API_KEY`, and optionally override `PORT`.

## Testing the Server

### Test the full server
With your server running (e.g. `npm run dev:local`), you can send a smoke test to `/health` and `/api/chat`:
```bash
npm test
```
The test script reads credentials from `.env` and prints the responses. Ensure `API_KEY` is set; otherwise it skips the chat call.

To validate your deployed instance (e.g. Render), run:
```bash
npm run test:remote
```
The `test:remote` script uses a fixed `BASE_URL=https://politician-trading-data-assistant.onrender.com`. Override that variable if your deployment lives elsewhere.

### Test the LLM service directly
To test the Hugging Face LLM integration in isolation:
```bash
npm run test:llm
```
This script tests the LLM service directly without requiring the full server to be running. You can customize the test message:
```bash
TEST_MESSAGE="What are the top traded assets?" npm run test:llm
```

## API Endpoints

### POST `/api/chat`

Processes user messages and returns the LLM-formatted summary (which may include MCP data).

**Headers:**
- `x-api-key`: Your API key (required)
- `x-user-id`: User identifier for conversation history (required)

**Request Body:**
```json
{
  "message": "What are the top traded assets by politicians?"
}
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "reply": "Summary of the MCP data with markdown formatting...",
  "mcpDataUsed": true
}
```

### GET `/health`

Health check endpoint.

**Response:**
```json
{
  "status": "ok"
}
```

## Environment Variables

- `HF_API_KEY` (required): Hugging Face API token
- `API_KEY` (required): Custom API key for request authentication
- `HF_MODEL_TYPE` (required): Hugging Face model identifier, e.g. `mistralai/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3` or `HuggingFaceTB/SmolLM3-3B`
- `PORT` (optional): Server port, defaults to 3000
- `GITHUB_PAGES_DOMAIN` (optional): GitHub Pages domain for CORS configuration
- `NODE_ENV` (optional): Environment mode (development/production)
- `TRUST_PROXY` (optional but recommended in production): Express `trust proxy` setting; use `1` on Render

## MCP Integration

The server integrates with the [MCP Capitol Trades](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@anguslin/mcp-capitol-trades) package via the Model Context Protocol. The following MCP functions are available:

- `get_top_traded_assets`: Get most traded assets by politicians
- `get_politician_stats`: Get statistics for a specific politician
- `get_asset_stats`: Get statistics for a specific asset/stock
- `get_buy_momentum_assets`: Get assets with high buy momentum
- `get_party_buy_momentum`: Get buy momentum by political party
- `get_politician_trades`: Get politician trades with filters

The LLM automatically selects the appropriate MCP function based on user queries, and the system includes fallback keyword-based detection if JSON parsing fails.

## Deployment on Render

1. Create a new Web Service on Render
2. Connect your GitHub repository
3. Set the root directory to `backend`
4. Set the following environment variables under **Environment > Environment Variables**:
   - `HF_API_KEY`: Same token you use locally (stored as a secret in Render)
   - `API_KEY`: Match the key your production frontend sends in the `x-api-key` header
   - `HF_MODEL_TYPE`: Model identifier to use in production
   - `TRUST_PROXY=1`: Required so Express honors `X-Forwarded-For` when behind Render's proxy
   - `GITHUB_PAGES_DOMAIN` (optional): Production domain allowed by CORS
5. Render injects the `PORT` automatically—do not hard-code it.
6. Click **Deploy**. Update secrets here whenever they rotate, then redeploy to apply.

## Security

- CORS is restricted to GitHub Pages domains
- API key validation via `x-api-key` header
- Rate limiting: 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP address
- Conversation history is stored locally per user (via `x-user-id` header)

## Notes

- Conversation history is stored in `history.json` (auto-created at startup and gitignored)
- Each user's history is limited to the last 30 messages (configurable via `MAX_MESSAGES_PER_USER` in `historyService.js`)
- Render's disk is ephemeral: `history.json` resets on deploys. Use an external store (e.g., database) if you need persistence across deployments
- The LLM attempts to parse user requests and automatically call appropriate MCP functions
- If JSON parsing fails, the system falls back gracefully using keyword-based detection
- The project uses the official `@huggingface/inference` SDK for LLM integration, which handles retries and error handling automatically
- The MCP client connects via stdio transport and spawns the MCP server process as needed
